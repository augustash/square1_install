# Square1 Install Profile

Square1 is an installation profile to be used as an alternative to `minimal` or `standard` when installing a Drupal 8 website. It contains improvements over the `standard` installation profile by enabling helpful modules, configuring default settings, and including a base theme to facilitate building Drupal websites faster.
